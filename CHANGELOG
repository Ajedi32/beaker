* local_setup.sh now expects the PATH and RUBYLIB to be set correctly.
Please do not rely on the $BIN environment variable when writing
acceptance tests.

* Cleaned up spec/util.sh to be more readable and contain standard
bourne shell syntax.

* Added killwait() function to help tear down the puppet master.

* Fixed hanging puppet master process in settings_section_deprecation_spec.sh
