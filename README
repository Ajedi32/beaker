WARNING WARNING WARNING
This suite of acceptance scripts will modify the system during testing.
Make SURE you run this suite on a system you do not care about.

It is recommended to run inside a Virtual Machine with a snapshot take
to easily "undo" the changes made to the system.

THESE SCRIPTS WILL LIKELY BREAK THINGS IF RUN ON AN SYSTEM YOU CARE ABOUT.

Getting Started:

1: Create a local_setup.sh script which sets RUBYLIB and PATH as you wish.
An example is provided which assumes puppet and facter exist in /opt/puppetlabs
2: run "make"
