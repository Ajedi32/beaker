Running the Distributed Test Harness


Pre-flight checks:

  - You will need at least one host machine, physical or virtual is fine.  The machine will need properly configured network.

  - On the your test host, you must configure pass through ssh auth for the root user.

Prepare a config file:

The test harness is configuration driven; the config file is yaml formated.  A basic config file sufficent for running tests against a single host:


HOSTS:
  hostname_of_test_machine:
    roles:
      - master
      - agent
    platform: centos-5-i386
CONFIG:
  rubyver: ruby18


Here we have the machine "hostname_of_test_machine", a Centos 5.x 32 bit box,, that will serve as a Pupppet master and Agent.

This represents a very basic config; more complex configs can be found under cfg_examples/.


Steps to run the acceptance tests:


./systest.rb -c your_cfg --type git -p 2.6.next  -f 1.5.8 -t tests/acceptance --debug

Results will be written to log/latest/summary.txt and runlog
