WARNING WARNING WARNING
This suite of acceptance scripts will modify the system during testing.
Make SURE you run this suite on a system you do not care about.

It is recommended to run inside a Virtual Machine with a snapshot take
to easily "undo" the changes made to the system.

THESE SCRIPTS WILL LIKELY BREAK THINGS IF RUN ON AN SYSTEM YOU CARE ABOUT.

Getting Started:

1: Create a local_setup.sh script which sets RUBYLIB and PATH as you wish.
An example is provided which assumes puppet and facter exist in /opt/puppetlabs
2: run "make"

Writing specifications:
* specification scripts should be written in BASH
* Expect the current working directory to be where the Makefile lives.
* The script should source spec/util.sh
* The script should source spec/setup.sh
* They should return $EXIT_FAIL on a test failure.
* The should return 0 or $EXIT_OK on test success.
* Any other exit code is treated as a testing error (not failure)

For an example of client / server testing, look at
./spec/settings_section_deprecation_spec.sh
